# LabFileDatabase

## About
This project has arisen out of my annoyance with Windows Explorer, the inability to add a description to a folder, and my love for uniform experiment names

This project is **NOT** another digital lab notebook. Instead, this project aims to organize all of the raw data files (images, qPCR files, FlowJo files, etc), figures, etc associated with a particular experiment into an easy to look at, navigable user interface. 

We do not aim to edit or manipulate data directly, rather to be able to navigate to a particular file from a particular experiment easily without having extremely long folder names or file names to provide an adequate description
